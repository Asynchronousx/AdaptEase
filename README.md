AdaptEase is an **AI-powered widget** designed to create a truly **inclusive reading experience** online. Primarily developed for **neurodivergent individuals** (dyslexia, ADHD, autism) but beneficial for all, it enables **real-time customization** of digital content for enhanced **clarity, readability, and accessibility**.

It features four key cognitive functions: **text chunking, linguistic simplification, a dyslexic font with increased spacing, and visual stimulation reduction (soft colors)**. AdaptEase seamlessly enhances reading on any website, supporting **multiple languages** without altering original content structure.

This **lightweight, scalable solution** integrates with just **one line of code**. Its frontend directly manipulates the DOM, while the **Flask-based backend** leverages **optimized open-source LLMs (Qwen)** for fast, cached, **multilingual inference**. All features are grounded in **scientific evidence** and **W3C cognitive accessibility standards**, ensuring real impact.

AdaptEase empowers **publishers, brands, and platforms** to offer more inclusive content, boosting **dwell time, reducing bounce rates, and strengthening ESG, SEO, and compliance** (Accessibility Act 2025).

## What AdaptEase Does

AdaptEase integrates seamlessly into any HTML page, offering a dynamic set of tools to improve readability and visual comfort. Below are the core functionalities, powered by an intelligent Python backend:

### 1. Text in Blocks (Chunking)

*   **What it does:** This feature intelligently breaks down long, dense paragraphs into smaller, more manageable blocks of text. Utilizing a powerful Language Model (LLM) running on the backend, AdaptEase analyzes the content and re-structures it into digestible segments. It also provides the capability to split content into "plain" and "highlighted" sections for specific use cases.
*   **Why it's important to the user:** Large blocks of text can be overwhelming and difficult to read, especially for individuals with cognitive load challenges, attention deficits, or those who prefer bite-sized information. Chunking improves scannability, reduces cognitive fatigue, and helps users focus on one idea at a time, leading to better comprehension.

### 2. Simplified Text

*   **What it does:** Leveraging the advanced capabilities of a large Language Model (LLM) (specifically, the Qwen model), the "Simplified Text" feature rewrites complex sentences and paragraphs into simpler, easier-to-understand language. It aims to remove jargon, convoluted sentence structures, metaphors, and abstract concepts, replacing them with more straightforward vocabulary and phrasing.
*   **Why it's important to the user:** Complex language can be a significant barrier to information access for many, including non-native speakers, individuals with reading disabilities (like dyslexia), or those with limited literacy. Text simplification makes content accessible to a broader demographic, fostering greater understanding and engagement with your content.

### 3. Readable Font

*   **What it does:** This feature applies a set of dyslexic-friendly fonts (primarily OpenDyslexic, with Lexend as a strong alternative) to the page's text content. In addition to changing the typeface, it also increases word spacing (`0.5em`), which is known to improve readability for some individuals by reducing letter crowding.
*   **Why it's important to the user:** Certain fonts and increased word spacing can significantly enhance readability for people with dyslexia by making character recognition easier. This feature provides a more comfortable and effective reading experience, reducing the strain often associated with reading traditional text.

### 4. Soft Colors (Desaturate Colors)

*   **What it does:** The "Soft Colors" feature adjusts the overall color scheme of the webpage to a softer, less intense palette. This is achieved by dynamically applying a CSS class (`adaptease-soft-colors-active`) to the `<html>` element, which then modifies background colors, text colors, and potentially other UI elements to reduce harsh contrasts and brightness.
*   **Why it's important to the user:** Bright, high-contrast colors can cause eye strain, glare, and discomfort, especially during prolonged reading or for individuals with light sensitivity, visual impairments, or certain neurological conditions. Soft colors create a more calming and gentle visual environment, reducing visual fatigue and making the content easier on the eyes for extended periods.

## Language Scalability & Customization

AdaptEase is designed with **multilingual scalability** in mind, making it easy to extend support to your preferred languages. To add a new language, you need to perform the following steps:

1.  **Modify `adaptease.html`**: Add a new `div` element within the `languageDropdown` with the `awm-v2-language-option` class and a `data-lang` attribute set to your new language's ISO 639-1 code (e.g., `data-lang="fr"` for French).
    ```html
    <!-- Example for adding a French option in adaptease.html -->
    <div class="awm-v2-language-option" data-lang="fr" role="option">
        <span class="awm-flag-icon">ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·</span> FranÃ§ais
    </div>
    ```

2.  **Update `assets/adaptease_translations.json`**: Add a new top-level key corresponding to your language's ISO code (e.g., `"fr"`) and provide translations for all UI text elements used by the widget. This ensures buttons, labels, and messages are displayed in the new language.

3.  **Add Language Prompts to `assets/prompts/`**: For the "Text in Blocks" (chunking) and "Simplified Text" features, you will need to create new prompt files for your language in the `assets/prompts/` directory. These files (`chunk_prompts.json` and `simplify_prompts.json`) are crucial for guiding the Language Model's behavior in your specific language. The structure should mirror the existing prompt files (e.g., `assets/prompts/en_chunk_prompts.json`, `assets/prompts/en_simplify_prompts.json`), but with content tailored for your new language.

By following these steps, you can significantly expand AdaptEase's linguistic capabilities, making it even more adaptable to global audiences.

## How to Use AdaptEase

Integrating AdaptEase into your existing HTML page is incredibly simple, embodying our slogan: **AdaptEase: It's EASY TO ADAPT!**

The widget handles its own HTML and CSS injection, requiring minimal setup on your part. The most crucial step is to tell AdaptEase which elements on your page contain the text it needs to process or modify.

1.  **Include the Script:** Place the following `<script>` tag right before the closing `</body>` tag in your HTML file:

    ```html
    <!-- 
        AdaptEase Widget Script Injection 
        - src: Path to your adaptease.js file.
        - type="module": Important for modern JavaScript, allows import/export.
        - defer: Ensures the script executes after the HTML is parsed but before DOMContentLoaded.
        - data-adaptease-text-class: Specifies the CSS selector for the text elements
                                        the widget should target.
    -->
    <script src="adaptease.js" 
            type="module" 
            defer
            data-adaptease-text-class=".foc-module-text p">
    </script>
    ```

2.  **Configure Your Text Container (`data-adaptease-text-class`):**
    The key to AdaptEase's adaptability is the `data-adaptease-text-class` attribute within the script tag. You **only** need to change the value of this attribute to the CSS selector that precisely targets the text elements you want AdaptEase to work with.

    *   **Example:** If your main article content is wrapped in a `<div id="article-body">` and paragraphs are within it, you might use `data-adaptease-text-class="#article-body p"`.
    *   **Your current configuration:** As seen in `index_focus.html`, it's set to `data-adaptease-text-class=".foc-module-text p"`, which targets all `<p>` tags located within elements that have the class `foc-module-text`.

    This minimal configuration ensures AdaptEase seamlessly integrates into your existing web ecosystem without requiring extensive modifications to your page's structure or styles.
